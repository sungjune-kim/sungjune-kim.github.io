# Welcome. 
[Back to personal page](https://sungjune-kim.github.io/)

I truly believe that when you want to say you *know* something, you should be proficient enough to *teach* it to someone else. This is why I am starting this blog, to make my vauge knowledges concrete by organizing them systemetically and logically. So, whoever the reader of this blog is, I hope the posts convey valuable insights. If you have any questions or find errors in the posts, please feel free to reach out! &rarr; ksjsungjune (at) korea.ac.kr
